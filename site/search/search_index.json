Creating the S3 bucket 2. Encrypt the bucket (This example uses AES256, but KMS and key rotation is recommended) 3. Restrict the access to the bucket:   1. Create an unpriviledged user   2. Give access to S3 and DynamoDB to this user (this example gives full access for simplicity, is recommended to just give less power to this user.) 4. Enforce the policy in the bucket.  5.
